 *         540. Single Element in a Sorted Array
 * 
 *         Given a sorted array consisting of only integers where every element appears twice except for one element which appears once. Find this single element that appears only once.

Example 1:
Input: [1,1,2,3,3,4,4,8,8]
Output: 2
Example 2:
Input: [3,3,7,7,10,11,11]
Output: 10
Note: Your solution should run in O(log n) time and O(1) space.


 * 
 *         思路： 二分法查找 index保证是对数后边得那个 然后判断两边那边事奇数个
