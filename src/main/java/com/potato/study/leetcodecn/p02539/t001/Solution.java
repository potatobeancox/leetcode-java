/**
 * 2539. Count the Number of Good Subsequences
 *
 * A subsequence of a string is good if it is not empty and the frequency of each one of its characters is the same.
 *
 * Given a string s, return the number of good subsequences of s. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
 *
 * A subsequence is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.
 *
 *  
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: s = "aabb"
 * Output: 11
 * Explanation: The total number of subsequences is 24. There are five subsequences which are not good: "aabb", "aabb", "aabb", "aabb", and the empty subsequence. Hence, the number of good subsequences is 24-5 = 11.
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: s = "leet"
 * Output: 12
 * Explanation: There are four subsequences which are not good: "leet", "leet", "leet", and the empty subsequence. Hence, the number of good subsequences is 24-4 = 12.
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input: s = "abcd"
 * Output: 15
 * Explanation: All of the non-empty subsequences are good subsequences. Hence, the number of good subsequences is 24-1 = 15.
 *  
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 * 1 <= s.length <= 104
 * s consists of only lowercase English letters.
